Coherence Transaction API for Spring Container

Coherence - 3.7.1
Coherence-Common - 2.1.0.27679
Drools - 5.2.0.Final
EclipseLink - 2.1.2

Some Credits goes to Drools developers : drools-persistence-jpa was taken as a reference implementation, one can see similiarities in most classes, though initial JPA implementation is tighten to Hibernate =( Current implementation can be used both with EclipseLink and Hibernate =P

Coherence Spring TM is a twin of JCA CCI implementation.

EclipseLink is used as a JPA provider for drools "long-running process"

To see basic functionality in action find 'DroolsCalculatorTest' and run it.
Enjoy =)
